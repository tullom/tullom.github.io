## introduction

hello world! this is the start of my blog, hopefully something i can **consistently** keep up (who am i kidding, this will probably be the only post).

i want to use this site to document my engineering projects and give life updates from time to time. i'm doing this for myself, so please dont expect anything neat or clean (how did you even get here?)

## why

a few reasons:
- ive never kept a consistent blog and this is my nth iteration. hopefully this sticks
- i should really explore outside my embedded comfort zone
- i should really stop scrolling social media

that should be good for now. its 230am here in beautiful san francisco and i have work tomorrow.
